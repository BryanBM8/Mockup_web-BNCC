The creation of this figma design is based on the qualification for acceptance as an activist of the Binus Computer Club. This design is designed in the form of a web design of a photography service provider and a portfolio of my own based on the experience that has been done. This design uses a dark theme that makes users more comfortable using it coupled with an exclusive and expensive feel.
